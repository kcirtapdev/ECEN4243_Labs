These files are used for Laboratory 1 within ECEN 4243 : Computer
Architecture.  The C files need a compiler and it is recommended to
use the ECE file server to compile these files.

To set up the envrionmental variable to use the GNU compiler.
These files should be available through cygwin (Windows) or Xtools
(Mac OS X).  You will also need the RISC-V tools which will be
available through docker if you want to add any more tests.  You can
also use the simple RISC-V intepreter available here:
https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3410/2019sp/riscv/interpreter/.
However, the best way to compile something is using RISC-V toolchain
that we have available.
